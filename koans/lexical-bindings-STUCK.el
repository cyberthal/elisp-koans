;; The closure gives the returned function access to the bindings, not just the
;; values.  This means that two functions which close over the same variables
;; will always see the same values of those variables if one does a setq.

;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; As shown in the line above, `lexical-binding' is set as a buffer local
;; variable. When set to `t' lexical bindings are enabled in the current buffer,
;; as opposed to dynamic bindings.

;; Relevant emacs info page: `(info "(elisp)Lexical Binding")'

;; Unless you have a particular reason not to, I'd recommend using lexical
;; bindings with new elisp source files. Lexical bindings are typical in modern
;; languages and match a common mental model. Dynamic bindings, while powerful,
;; can allow variable bindings to interact in surpising ways.
