I assume this is user error, but I'm still stuck.  Cheat sheet branch is same as main branch for this file.

I've gone through about half of the koans, in alphabetical order, and am now stuck on =lexical-bindings.el=, a concept I already understood.

Here's my solution:

#+begin_src elisp
(elisp-koans/deftest
 elisp-koans/lexical-bindings-closure-interactions ()
 "An illustration of how lexical closures may interact."
 (let ((tangled-funs-1 (elisp-koans/two-funs 1))
       ;; ((lambda nil 1) (lambda (y) (setq x y)))
       (tangled-funs-2 (elisp-koans/two-funs 2)))
   ;; ((lambda nil 2) (lambda (y) (setq x y)))

   (should (equal 1 (funcall (first tangled-funs-1))))
   (funcall (second tangled-funs-1) 0) ; x=0
   (should (equal 0 (funcall (first tangled-funs-1))))

   (should (equal 2 (funcall (first tangled-funs-2))))
   (funcall (second tangled-funs-2) 100) ; x=100
   (should (equal 100 (funcall (first tangled-funs-2))))))
#+end_src

Running =elisp-koans/run-test= returns 

#+begin_src elisp

#+end_src

I don't know how to run this with a debugger to get a more meaningful output.
