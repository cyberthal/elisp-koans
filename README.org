* elisp-koans

** What is elisp-koans?
   
   =elisp-koans= helps you learn [[info:elisp:Introduction][Emacs Lisp]] (elisp) via test-driven development.
   You're provided with suites of tests describing the elisp syntax and
   environment. Fixing the tests leads you on a tutorial of elisp.
   
   These koans are intended for those learning to code in Emacs Lisp and
   - customize Emacs. You should already be able to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][make your way around Emacs]]
   plus be able to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Interactive-Call.html][call interactive functions]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Eval.html][evaluate code in the buffer]], and
   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Help-Functions.html][look up documentation]].

** Usage

*** setup

   Create a clone of this repository:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans
   #+END_SRC

*** each time

   First load [[file:elisp-koans.el][elisp-koans.el]] by opening it in Emacs then running the interactive
   command =eval-buffer=.

   Next open up [[file:koans/asserts.el::(elisp-koans/define-test][koans/asserts.el]] and navigate to the first test:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (elisp-koans/deftest
      elisp-koans/asserts-true ()
      "`t' is true. Replace the blank with `t' to assert it is true"
      (should ___))
   #+END_SRC

   Fix the test by replacing the blank (=___=) with the appropriate value, in
   this case =t= as described in the docstring:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (should t)
   #+END_SRC

   Once the test is fixed evaluate the test and then run it by calling
   =elisp-koans/run-test= and selecting the test: =elisp-koans/asserts-true=.
   ERT will run the test and report the result.

   You're ready to move on to the remaining koans in =koans/asserts.el= and
   beyond. The variable =elisp-koans-groups= lists the remaining suites of koans
   which are ordered to provide a tour of Emacs Lisp. As you progress run all of
   the loaded koans by calling =elisp-koans/contemplate=, or a single test by
   calling =elisp-koans/run-test=.

** The Cheatsheet

   You can check your answers against the cheatsheet, i.e. a branch called
   =cheatsheet= which has the koan solutions filled in. This branch is kept up
   to date by staying one commit ahead of =master=
